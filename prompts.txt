AI Tools Used in Development


I used AI tools (ChatGPT and Cursor.ai) to help with this project in the following ways:

1. Project Setup
   - To setup a Spring Boot project with ClickHouse?"
   - Used this to understand the basic structure and dependencies

2. Coding Help
   - Used Cursor.ai to review my code and suggest improvements
   - Asked for help with specific implementation challenges

3. Testing
   - Got suggestions for test cases from ChatGPT
   - Used Cursor.ai to check for potential bugs
